    <h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
    <h2>DC Heroes</h2>
    <p>I'm not invested enough in superheroes to have a proper preference between DC or Marvel. <br>
      <strong>I guess my favorite DC hero is Batman.</strong></p>

    <h3>Marvel Heroes</h3>
    <p>I've always taken a little issue with <u>how numerous the current MCU lineup is</u>, making it necessary to catch up on dozens of films to catch up the longer it goes. My favorite Marvel hero is <q>Spiderman.</q></p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <blockquote>I guess I don't have a preference since <em>I don't watch TV shows or movies regularly.</em> I'm certainly interested, but can never find the proper motivation.</blockquote>
